### Hi there 👋, I am Pietro 👨‍👩‍👧

I like 💻code and 🧮math, 🤖algorithms and 🐝APIs, 💬natural and ⌨️programming languages[^💜].

I code mostly in Python🐍 and [Nim](https://nim-lang.org)👑, but I enjoy learning about languages in general. And learning in general I guess 🤓.

Nim is what actually motivated me to start playing the open source game ❤️. I try to help the community.

📫 You can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pietroppeter) or [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@pietroppeter)

### 🐳 Nimib-land

My main open source project is [nimib](https://github.com/pietroppeter/nimib) and its ecosystem.
It is sort of a jupyter notebook for Nim but not exactly, check it out and let me know if you like it!

I am very happy that I was joined by [Hugo](https://github.com/hugogranstrom) in co-creating and mantaining the library,
we try to do 🎪[speaking hours](https://github.com/pietroppeter/nimib/discussions/categories/nimib-speaking-hours)
(ideally) once every month, they are open to curious people, come join us!

### 📺 Talks

- 🐍📈[Time Series Forecasting with Nixtla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMHvdabYEm8), Python Milano, May 2023
- 👑🐳[Nimib goes interactive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ7wX1kgnuc), NimConf, October 2022

### Local communities

Here in Milan you will often find me at events by [Python Milano](https://milano.python.it)🐍 or [![Open Source Saturday](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F-open%20source%20saturday-F64060.svg)](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/Open-Source-Saturday-Milano/).

At some point I will likely start organizing a Nim meet-up in Milan, if you want to help organize, contact me!
In the meantime we have a Telegram group [Nim Italia](https://t.me/nimitalia)

### 🌟 Favorites

- 🌱✨ **Plant App**: a significant milestone in my nimib adventures was being able to incorporate interactivity. This clone of a shiny app about a fern generated by 2-d parametric equations has a special place in my heart. Click show source to see how clean nim code can be: [nblog/plant_app.html](https://pietroppeter.github.io/nblog/drafts/plant_app.html?utm_source=github-pietroppeter)
- 🐳🎶 **Whale Music**: while doing advent of code (Day 3, 2021) I went into a rabbit hole while trying to use input data to create some music. It came out some decent jazz! You can skip the weird story and go directly to the 10 minute sample at the end to check if you want to read more: [2021/day03.html#whale_music](https://pietroppeter.github.io/adventofnim/2021/day03.html#whale_music?utm_source=github-pietroppeter)
- 🖼️🌸 **おかず's Generative Art**: at some point I discovered processing/p5nim and fell in love! I refreshed some old bindings and started to port some examples and art found on openprocessing. My favorite generative artist is definitely Okazz/おかず, just look at how beatiful this is: [p5nim/okazz_220919a.html](https://pietroppeter.github.io/p5nim/okazz_220919a.html?utm_source=github-pietroppeter)

### Other

- 🟩🇮🇹 I wanted to play _wordle in Italian_ with friends (we still do) but it seems some people joined us... [par🇮🇹le](https://github.com/pietroppeter/wordle-it) is actually a snapshot of the original (unclear legal status 😨) but I have set up a version based on an open source clone ([par-le/gioco](https://github.com/par-le/gioco)), just in case.
- 🌍📈 I manage _public web analytics_ for most of my sites and some other, see [pietroppeter/public-analytics](https://github.com/pietroppeter/public-analytics)

[^💜]: if you also love programming languages and you do not know about [exercism](https://exercism.org/) I encourage you to take a look.
      It is a wonderful platform and community for learning programming languages that relies on word of mouth to grow.
      If you find it interesting please consider joining me in subscribing to their fantastic [insiders program](https://exercism.org/insiders) 🙏. It is totally worth it! 🤩
