### Plausible Analytics

I track analytics on a few nim projects using https://plausible.io/.

Analytics dashboards are all public and you should be able to access them using the following pages:

- [nimib](https://plausible.io/pietroppeter.github.io%2Fnimib) ([repo](https://github.com/pietroppeter/nimib))
- [nblog](https://plausible.io/pietroppeter.github.io%2Fnblog) ([repo](https://github.com/pietroppeter/nblog))
- [adventofnim](https://plausible.io/pietroppeter.github.io%2Fadventofnim) ([repo](https://github.com/pietroppeter/adventofnim))
- [nimibook](https://plausible.io/pietroppeter.github.io%2Fnimibook) ([repo](https://github.com/pietroppeter/nimibook))
- [scinim/getting-started](https://plausible.io/scinim.github.io%2Fgetting-started) ([repo](https://github.com/SciNim/getting-started))

You can opt out with [standard ad-blocking](https://plausible.io/docs/excluding) or with a simple command in browser console: https://plausible.io/docs/excluding-localstorage

I might set up specific pages to opt out of analytics directly inside the sites, to simplify opting out from mobile.
